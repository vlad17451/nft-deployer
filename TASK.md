Solidity Test Task

1. Develop a smart contract(-s) on Solidity for deploying a NFT collection (ERC721) with
   some arguments (name, symbol). The smart contract should emit the following events:
   a. CollectionCreated(address collection, name, symbol)
   b. TokenMinted(address collection, address recipient, tokenId, tokenUri)
2. Develop a simple backend server with in-memory storage to handle emitted events and
   serve it via HTTP.
3. Develop a front end demo application that interacts with the smart contract and has the
   following functionality:
   a. Create a new NFT collection with specified name and symbol (from user input);
   b. Mints a new NFT with specified collection address (only created on 3.a), tokenId,
   tokenUri.
   Estimated time: ~ 60 minutes.
